DiscordDL is the best way to download future *or* already existing **images, GIFs and Videos** from Discord Textchannels.
Want to see how? <span style="color:red">Sure!</span>


## Usage

Like seen in the following image, the program will always ask you what you want to do, and will do nothing except what you tell the program to do.
*except for the discord and the npm servers, the program will also never connnect to any servers, providing security for your token and privacy details*
